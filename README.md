# Improving_MultComp
This repository aims to improve the output generated from multiple comparisons

It is based on the paper: I know what I shouldnâ€™t say, but what should I say? An approach to present results without statistical significance
I really liked the table presented in this paper. It might be something interesting to consider in future analysis

Because of that I want to create a new funcion to decribe the results in line with their suggestions
